        <p>Today on October 16th was Wednesday. I woke up at 7:00 am. Got ready for school and left at 7:45 am. It was pretty hard day in school. We had Math and Croatian, also Mirso questioned us. I got home at 14:00 pm. I ate launch and helped my dad do somethings around the house. Then I took a nap and woke up at 18:00 pm. I had dinner and now I'm doing this blog.
